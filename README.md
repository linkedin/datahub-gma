## Introduction

General Metadata Architecture (GMA) is the backend for [DataHub](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub), LinkedIn's
generalized metadata search & discovery tool. To learn more about DataHub, check out its
[GitHub page](https://github.com/linkedin/datahub).

You should also visit [GMA Architecture](docs/architecture/architecture.md) to get a better understanding of how GMA is
implemented and [GMA Onboarding Guide](docs/how/entity-onboarding.md) to understand how to extend GMA for your own use
cases.

This repository contains the _partial_ source code for GMA. It originally lived in the same GitHub repository as
DataHub. We're still in the process of moving it all over.
